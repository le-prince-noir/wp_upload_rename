Change upload filename to random characters / random numbers / date / other by yourself.

== Description ==

Sometimes we forgot change our file to a available name. So the plugin can help you auto change your upload file.
I will add a filetype option of setting in next version.
And a rename popup before the file upload if you change setting in future, default value is post_name.
